I created this app to help gather and average blood pressure. 

This app will walk someone through taking their 
    blood pressure three times and will find the 
    average of the following: SYS, DIA, PUL. 

All of the code lives in funcitions.py and is called from app.py.

This was done as a way to practice importing libraries and passing 
    in variable values.
