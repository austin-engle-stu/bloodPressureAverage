I created this app to help gather and average blood pressure.

## -- Python App --
- Version 1 of the app that is run via the command line
- This app will walk someone through taking their
blood pressure three times and will find the
average of the following: SYS, DIA, PUL.
- All of the code lives in funcitions.py and is called from app.py.
    - This was done as a way to practice importing libraries and passing
in variable values.

## -- Node App --
- Version 2 of the app that will run on express node and be a web application. This is mainly for practice and learning new technolgies, and ability to use without my laptop.
